            <h3>AlphaV Camera Power Supply</h3>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I designed the AlphaV with a few key priorities in mind. First and foremost, the unit had to
                operate silently, which meant forgoing a fan to adhere to noise limitations. This required incorporating
                ample ventilation to prevent overheating. Additionally, the housing had to strike a balance between a
                sleek, durable appearance and effective protection for the internal components. To ensure convenient
                transport, I included a rope handle which required its own set of internal parts for mounting. These
                parts were designed to fit snugly within the tight confines of the frame. The end result is a compact,
                fanless system with optimal heat management and a seamlessly integrated rope handle, tailored to meet
                the specific demands of on-set practicality.</p>
