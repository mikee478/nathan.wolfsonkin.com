            <h3>Apex 360W Battery Pack</h3>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;When I designed mechanicals of the Apex High Voltage battery pack, my emphasis was on a
                robust, sleek shell with a user-friendly design that complements its powerful internals. The
                injection-molded front seamlessly aligns with the pre-existing rear, achieving a clean, sturdy overall
                look. Notably, the design ensures the LED indicator lights are viewable from all angles, enhancing user
                convenience. Striking a balance between a sleek appearance and effective internal protection was
                crucial. The Apex battery pack is the result of this approach, offering style and functionality tailored
                to the specific demands of film industry professionals.</p>
