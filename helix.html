            <h3>Helix Max Battery Pack</h3>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I designed the Helix Max with key priorities in mind. The goal was to achieve a sleek and
                robust aesthetic reminiscent of the Apex. I incorporated a backlit runtime LCD screen, ensuring quick
                access to essential information such as estimated and actual runtime, charge status, and remaining
                capacity. Taking ergonomic considerations into account, I aimed to provide a comfortable and
                user-friendly experience for industry professionals. The wrap-around LED gauge and rugged polycarbonate
                housing were meticulously crafted to enhance the Helix Max's identity as a reliable, high-performance
                power source. This mechanical design seamlessly combines convenience, ergonomic elements, and
                durability, meeting the specific demands of professionals in the cinema industry.</p>
