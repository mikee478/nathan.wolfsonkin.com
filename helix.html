            <h3>Helix Max Battery Pack</h3>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The Helix Max's mechanical design was shaped by three distinct objectives. Firstly, it sought
                to embody the robust and sleek design characteristics of the Apex, ensuring both strength and style in
                its construction. Second, it prioritized the seamless integration of a backlit runtime LCD screen,
                providing quick and easy access to critical information such as estimated and actual runtime, charge
                status, and remaining capacity. Third, the design incorporated ergonomic considerations, ensuring a
                comfortable and user-friendly experience for professionals in the field. The wrap-around LED gauge and
                rugged polycarbonate housing further enhance the Helix Max's durability and ease of use, delivering a
                reliable, high-performance power source that seamlessly combines convenience, ergonomic design, and
                durability in its mechanical design.</p>
